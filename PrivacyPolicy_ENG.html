                            <br />
                            When a user makes an aggregate lifetime total of deposits exceeding USD 2000 or requests a withdrawal of any amount inside the luckyfanta.com Platform, then it is compulsory for them to perform a full KYC process.  <br />
                            During this process, the user will have to input some basic details about themselves and then upload<br /><br />
                            1)	A copy of Government Issued Photo ID (in some cases front and back depending on the doc)<br />
                            2)	A selfie of themselves holding the ID doc<br />
                            3)	A bank statement/Utility Bill<br /><br />
                            Once uploaded, the user will get a “Temporarily Approved” Status and the documents will now be on our side, and the “KYC Team” will have 24hrs to go over them and email the user about the outcome:<br /><br />
                            -	Approval<br />
                            -	Rejection<br />
                            -	More information needed – No change in Status<br /><br />
                            When the user is on “Temporarily Approved” Status then <br /><br />
                            -	They can use the platform normally <br />
                            -	They cannot deposit more than USD 500 in aggregate total<br />
                            -	They cannot complete any withdrawal. <br />
